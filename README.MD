In this project, the primary objective was to establish a secure and efficient website hosting infrastructure within the confines of an AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The foundational step involved the creation of a custom VPC, providing a dedicated and isolated network environment tailored to the specific requirements of the web application. This VPC served as a virtualized data center in the cloud, enabling precise control over network configurations and security settings.

The VPC architecture incorporated various terminologies to enhance security and segmentation. Public and private subnets were strategically configured to demarcate distinct layers of the infrastructure. Two public subnets were established to host components that required direct internet access, such as web servers, while two private subnets were designated for resources that demanded a higher level of security, such as database servers. This division facilitated the implementation of a multi-tiered architecture, optimizing security and performance.

To enable communication between the VPC and the internet, an Internet Gateway was created and seamlessly attached to the VPC. This gateway served as the entry and exit point for public-facing resources, allowing secure and controlled access. Route tables were meticulously configured to direct traffic, with one associated with the public subnets and another with the private subnets. This segregation ensured that only the necessary components had internet connectivity, fortifying the overall security posture of the infrastructure.

For outbound internet access from the private subnets, a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway was deployed, accompanied by an Elastic IP for a consistent and static public IP address. This arrangement allowed private resources to access the internet for necessary updates and configurations while maintaining a secure and controlled environment.

In the public subnets, a bastion host was strategically placed to provide secure access to resources residing in the private subnets. This bastion host acted as a secure gateway, allowing authorized users to access and manage the more sensitive components of the infrastructure.

To ensure high availability and distribute incoming traffic efficiently, an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) was implemented. This component dynamically routed incoming web traffic across instances in the private subnets, enhancing both performance and fault tolerance. Additionally, Amazon Route 53, the DNS management service, played a pivotal role in associating domain names with the various components of the infrastructure.

The successful deployment and hosting of the website within this meticulously designed AWS VPC not only demonstrated a commitment to security but also showcased a scalable and well-architected solution. By leveraging VPC terminologies and employing best practices, the project achieved a robust and controlled environment, ensuring the seamless operation of the web application while maintaining a high standard of security.

The project documentation includes a comprehensive PDF file that provides a detailed understanding of the project's execution. This document serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders involved in the project, offering insights into the infrastructure setup, configuration steps, and overall architecture within the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). It acts as a guide for project execution, enabling team members to follow a structured approach in implementing the various components and ensuring successful deployment.

In addition to the PDF documentation, the inclusion of a web.sh file further streamlines the execution process. This script, designed for execution in Git Bash, encapsulates a set of commands that are instrumental in managing and deploying the website within the AWS environment. The web.sh file serves as an executable script, providing a clear and concise set of instructions for tasks such as deploying application code, configuring resources, and managing the website infrastructure.

Together, these resources, the PDF documentation, and the web.sh script contribute to a well-documented and user-friendly project environment. This approach not only facilitates seamless collaboration among project team members but also ensures that the execution process is standardized and accessible to individuals with varying levels of expertise. The combination of detailed documentation and an executable script enhances the project's transparency, reproducibility, and overall ease of implementation.
